## 0.0.4+7

* Improved example toString again

## 0.0.4+6

* Improved example toString

## 0.0.4+5

* Removed unused UnitExample.isLastExample 

## 0.0.4+4

* Removed nullability from the `systemUnderTest` inside a `UnitScenario`.

## 0.0.4+3

* Update readme.

## 0.0.4+2

* Update readme.

## 0.0.4+1

* Updated the `UnitScenario`'s `TestGroupFunction`'s with the proper `SUT` generic.

## 0.0.4

* **‚ú® New:** Added the option to add a `systemUnderTest` from higher up the tree (e.g. `UnitFeature` and `UnitTest`).
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** Added the `UnitMocks` object that gets passed around from initialising your `systemUnderTest` until your last `UnitStep` to facilitate better mocks integration.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** The `systemUnderTest` will now persist through all `UnitStep`s and `UnitExample`s of a `UnitScenario`.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** The `systemUnderTest` may now also be defined inside a `UnitFeature` or `UnitTest` and will cascade down to a `UnitScenario`. If a child has a new `systemUnderTest` defined it will use that instead.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** The `systemUnderTest` method of our main classes (`UnitTest`, `UnitFeature` or `UnitScenario`) will always be called before any other method inside that class.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** All set up methods (`setUpEach`, `setUpOnce`, `tearDownEach` and `tearDownOnce`) inside all parent classes (`UnitTest`, `UnitFeature` and `UnitScenario`) will now have access to the new `UnitMocks` object, as well as any `systemUnderTest` you might have initialised in one of those classes.

## 0.0.3

* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** Replaces the `result` parameter (now `box`) of the `UnitStepCallback` with an instance of `UnitBox`. This will allow you to save multiple persistent values throughout a series of steps inside the `box` instead of passing around a maximum of one single value as a `result` through multiple steps.
* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** Removed the recently introduces extension methods for cast a result since `result` has now been replaces with the new `UnitBox` which has this functionality built in.

## 0.0.2+1

* Added `asType` and `asNullableType` extension methods for easier usage of an `UnitStep`'s result.

## 0.0.2

* **‚ö†Ô∏è Breaking:** Added generic argument to scenario for easier example usage.
